ðŸŒŸ Day 99 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange ðŸŒŸ
Today, I continued developing the seller-side functionality, enabling sellers to clearly view orders and understand the billing for each transaction. This brings us closer to a complete, two-sided order management system. ðŸ“¦ðŸ’¼ðŸ“Š

ðŸŽ¯ What I worked on:

1. Built a dedicated Orders section for sellers, allowing them to review incoming buyer orders.
2. Integrated a comprehensive Bill section within each order, showing full purchase details including product info, quantity, pricing, and buyer data.

Excited to move forward â€” next up: enabling sellers to manage delivery statuses! ðŸ”¥
