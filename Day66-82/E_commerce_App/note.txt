🌟 Day 82 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange 🌟
Today, I implemented a confirmation popup system for deleting products — users must now confirm before
 any deletion action is processed. This adds a vital layer of protection and ensures only the rightful
  owner can perform the delete action. 🔒🗑️

🎯 What I worked on:
1. Designed a modal popup that triggers when a user clicks the Delete button.
2. Implemented confirmation options: Yes, Delete and Cancel* enhancing UX safety.
3. Performed secure deletion via a `DELETE` request only if the product belongs to the logged-in user.
4. Validated ownership on the backend by matching the JWT token's user ID with the product’s `owner`.
5. Ensured only authorized deletions by sellers/admins, boosting platform reliability.

The seller panel is now safer and more responsible — empowering users with full control over their
 listings without risk of accidental deletion! 🚀✅
