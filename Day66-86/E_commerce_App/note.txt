🌟 Day 86 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange 🌟
Today, I focused on building a charming and user-friendly Seller Onboarding UI — allowing normal users to 
seamlessly apply to become official sellers on the platform. 🛍️💼✨

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Created a complete React-based Seller Onboarding page inspired by Daraz's UX principles.
2. Built modular components including:

   * A dynamic hero section with a call-to-action to scroll to the form
   * Informational sections explaining why users should sell on our platform
   * A clean and responsive application form for seller registration
   * FAQ section for resolving common doubts
3. Implemented a preview feature that shows sample NID document format before upload.
4. Allowed users to upload official documents (NID front/back, address proof) via a form with `multipart/form-data`.
