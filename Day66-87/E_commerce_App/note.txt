🌟 Day 86 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange 🌟
Today, I focused on improving both the frontend and backend for the Seller 
Onboarding feature — making the process smoother, clearer, and more appealing
 for users who want to become official sellers. 🛍️✨

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Designed a clean and structured UI by organizing key components side by side 
— emphasizing the main application area.
2. Enhanced the sample image preview popup — added a background blur effect to 
highlight the preview and guide the user experience better.
3. Created a MongoDB schema and model to store seller application data — including 
fields for validation and approval flow.
4. Set up proper backend routing to manage seller-related data and connect it seamlessly with the frontend.

⚙️ Next Up:
Improving backend validation, admin approval workflow, and sending confirmation 
messages after application submission.

Making exciting progress toward launch! 🚀
