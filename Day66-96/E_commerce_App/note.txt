🌟 Day 96 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange 🌟
Today, I focused on writing the backend logic for placing orders, 
which marks a major step in connecting the checkout flow to the database and making orders functional! 🛠️🛒📦

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Set up API integration to send order data from the frontend to the
 backend seamlessly.
2. Designed an Order Schema in the database, referencing both user and 
product collections for proper data linkage.
3. Structured the backend using the MVC architecture, ensuring cleanrouting, better code organization, and scalability.

Excited for what’s next — looking forward to adding order tracking and admin controls! 🔥
