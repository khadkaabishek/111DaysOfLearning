🌟 Day 90 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange 🌟
Today, I focused on building the backend logic for admin controls — 
enabling a secure and scalable way to manage seller applications.
 This completes the foundation for handling seller approvals right from the admin dashboard. 🧠🔐🧾

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Added `userID` as a reference in the seller application schema to
 uniquely associate each request with a user.
2. Built a controller to fetch all seller requests, allowing admins 
to view pending and reviewed applications.
3. Created a `PATCH` route to approve or reject seller applications 
based on admin actions from the frontend.
4. Used Postman to test and validate all endpoints for smooth frontend integration.

Excited to connect these backend features with real frontend buttons next —
bringing seller approval logic to life with live updates and cleaner UX! 🚀
