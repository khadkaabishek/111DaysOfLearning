🌟 Day 78 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange 🌟
Today, I worked on building the frontend logic for a cart management system in React,
 where users can select how many items they want to add to their cart — while respecting 
 the available stock limit 🚀🎯

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Added a quantity selection system that lets users pick between 1 and the product’s
 `noOfQuantityAvailable`
2. Displayed `noOfQuantityAvailable` on the product detail view to guide user decisions
3. Set up an “Add to Cart” button that sends the product ID, selected quantity, and color 
to the backend (backend part coming soon)
4. Improved conditional UI rendering for roles:
5. Made sure the quantity logic is strictly enforced to avoid invalid purchases

Frontend interactions are now more realistic and smarter – super happy to see quantity logic +
 role-based UI working together! 🙌🛒
