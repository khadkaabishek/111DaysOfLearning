🌟 Day 105 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange 🌟

Today was all about fixing issues that came up after adding new features — and making sure the UI and logic flow stay smooth and sharp. ⚙️🧠

🎯 What I worked on:
i) Fixed an infinite re-render issue with the draggable price filter by wrapping the handler in `useCallback`.
ii) Resolved a confusing bug where Google login was returning `_id` but my code was using `id`. Adjusted logic and MongoDB schema accordingly.
iii) Handled long product names in the billing layout — no more overflow madness!

📌 GitHub Repo: 

✅ Codebase is feeling cleaner, smarter, and more stable.
Super pumped to host this live soon and see it in action! 🚀
