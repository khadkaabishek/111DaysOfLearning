ðŸŒŸ Day 109 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange ðŸŒŸ
Today, I focused on product-level sales insights â€” helping sellers understand which products are performing best with clear visualizations! ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š

ðŸŽ¯ What I worked on:
i) Built a pie chart view using `recharts` to break down product-wise sales contribution.
ii) Cleaned and structured the backend API to serve seller-specific product analytics.
iii) Ensured real-time inventory updates by reducing `quantityAvailable` after each order.
iv) Enhanced visual clarity with better chart labeling and optimized data mapping.
