ðŸŒŸ Day 108 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange ðŸŒŸ
Today, I worked on building the Seller Analytics page â€” giving sellers the power to track their sales performance over time! ðŸ“ˆðŸ›’

ðŸŽ¯ What I worked on:
i) Fetched nested order data using advanced `.populate()` to extract daily sales linked to each seller.
ii) Integrated `recharts` to show daily sales growth visually.
iii) Utilized `date-fns` for formatting and filtering data by specific dates.
iv) Cleaned and modularized the codebase with reusable service functions for better structure.

Data-driven dashboards are coming alive â€” and I'm excited to keep pushing forward! ðŸ’ªðŸš€
