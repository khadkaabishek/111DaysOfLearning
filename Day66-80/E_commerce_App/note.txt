ðŸŒŸ Day 80 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange ðŸŒŸ
Today, I worked on enhancing the user cart functionality â€” users can now add, 
remove, and manipulate quantities of items in the cart. The cart dynamically updates
 the total payable amount using the `.reduce()` method, which I revisited after quite some time! ðŸ›’ðŸ§ 

ðŸŽ¯ What I worked on:

1. Enabled dynamic quantity manipulation with `+` and `â€“` buttons directly in the cart.
2. Implemented item removal logic for better user control.
3. Calculated the total payable amount in real-time using the `.reduce()` method.
4. Added safeguards to prevent setting quantity below 1 or exceeding available stock.
5. Enhanced cart UI for better interactivity and price transparency.

The cart now feels much more interactive, realistic, and user-friendly â€” a major step forward in the shopping experience! ðŸš€âœ¨
