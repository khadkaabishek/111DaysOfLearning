Today, I implemented a fully functional search ba feature by enabling smooth communication between components — helping users discover items quickly and intuitively. 🔍⚡🧩

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Built a responsive `SearchBar` component to handle user input efficiently.
2. Lifted the search query state up to the parent dashboard for centralized control.
3. Filtered and passed real-time results to the child display component.
