🌟 Day 103 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange 🌟
Today, I explored OAuth 2.0, the standard behind those “Login with Google/Facebook” buttons — diving into how authentication and authorization actually work under the hood. 🔐🌐✨

🎯 What I worked on:
i) Understood the full OAuth 2.0 flow — including generation and verification of authorization codes.
ii) Set up my first Google OAuth Client ID via Google Cloud Console.
iii) Rendered a basic Google Sign-In button and triggered the account selection popup.
iv) Faced a COOP-related error during implementation — noted it down to fix later.

✅ Gained a solid understanding of third-party authentication systems.
Next up: Debug COOP issue and connect the OAuth data to backend storage! 🚀🔧
