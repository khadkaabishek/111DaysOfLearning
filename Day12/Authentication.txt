Authentication  In node js   two patterns  1) Stateful : Maintains data or server side    Example : checking manually tokens ( ie maintains certain state), real life eg . If U visit certain mall u have to keep your things outside  or if u give your  things to others for certain time then he will give you tokens that is associated with your items and  when u come back then show ur tokens and u will get ur items .  Where tokens is the key and the thing that the storer is noting is the state .   In node js , client inputs username and password to the server then server returns uid or  and when client needs to come back then he can come and accesss that data .  How to transfer uid?  - cookies  - response   - headers   in case of SSR , we do use cookies  and in case of REST apis , we do use headers   Express flow ? client —> Authentication Middleware  — > endPoint Route   where Auth Middleware checks the cookies values if valid then call next() else reject the request.    2)Stateless : Having no state    (Will be continued  … )
