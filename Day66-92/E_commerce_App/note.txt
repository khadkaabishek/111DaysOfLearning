ðŸŒŸ Day 92 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange ðŸŒŸ
Today, I implemented the notification feature on my platform â€” making the system more interactive and user-friendly by keeping users informed about critical updates like seller request approvals or rejections. ðŸ””âœ…ðŸ“¢

ðŸŽ¯ What I worked on:

1. Created a notification icon with dropdown functionality for a seamless user experience.
2. Designed and implemented a Notification Schema to store user-specific notifications in the database.
3. Wrote condition-based messages (e.g., approval â†’ success message, rejection â†’ rejection message).
4. Integrated backend and frontend to fetch and display notifications without needing Postman for API testing â€” feels like my concepts are really solidifying!

Excited to move towards real-time notifications using WebSockets or Pusher next! ðŸš€ðŸ”¥
