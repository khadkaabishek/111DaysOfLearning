🌟 Day 83 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange 🌟
Today, I enhanced the seller experience by adding visibility, control, and ownership protection on the platform.
 Sellers can now manage only their products, and each product clearly shows who uploaded it — boosting trust and clarity. 👤🛍️

🎯 What I worked on:
1. Allowed sellers to **edit products only if they are the original uploader — ensuring secure ownership validation.
2. Created a dedicated seller dashboard page that shows only the logged-in seller’s items.
3. Utilized Mongoose’s `.populate()` method to display seller name and email on product detail pages.
4. Fixed various bugs and overlooked issues from previous implementations to stabilize user experience.

The seller system now offers clearer identity, restricted access control, and smoother management —
 a solid step toward a secure and scalable marketplace experience! 🚀✅
