🌟 Day 100 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange 🌟
Today marks a big milestone! I focused on building out the delivery status management system, bridging the final gap between sellers dispatching orders and buyers confirming deliveries. This flow adds accountability and clarity to every transaction. 🚚✅📬

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Implemented a “Dispatched” button for sellers to update delivery progress once an order leaves their hands.
2. Enabled sellers to mark orders as “Delivered”, which automatically triggers notifications to the buyer.
3. Added a buyer-side verification step to confirm receipt — especially useful for Cash on Delivery cases.

Excited to keep going — the system is becoming more user-friendly and real-world ready! 🔥
