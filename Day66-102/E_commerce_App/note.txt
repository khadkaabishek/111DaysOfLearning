🌟 Day 102 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange 🌟
Today, I separated products by categories and created a draggable price filter — enhancing the browsing experience by letting users filter products intuitively and interactively. 🛍️🎚️✨

🎯 What I worked on:
Grouped products dynamically based on their categories for easier navigation.
Built a smooth, draggable price filter component to control min-max values.
Integrated category and price filtering to improve real-time product discovery.
