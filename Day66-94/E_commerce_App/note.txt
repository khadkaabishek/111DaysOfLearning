ðŸŒŸ Day 94 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange ðŸŒŸ
Today, I focused on enhancing the Cart UI to streamline 
the payment process and give users a clear understanding 
of their order summary. A good cart experience builds 
confidence before checkout! ðŸ›’ðŸ’³

ðŸŽ¯ What I worked on:

1. Designed a responsive Cart UI split into two sections 
â€” one for cart items, and another for billing info.
2. Added a detailed Bill Summary section displaying total 
payable amount.
3. Introduced a default â‚¹100 shipping fee, auto-applied 
to orders for now.

Excited for whatâ€™s next! ðŸ”¥
