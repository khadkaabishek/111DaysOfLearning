🌟 Day 98 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange 🌟
Today, I continued refining the order flow on both frontend
 and backend, aiming for a seamless buyer experience and clean 
 data management post-purchase. It’s all coming together step by step! 🧾🛠️🛒

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Made a slight change in the Order Schema — now taking a snapshot of the cart at the time of order to preserve product details and safely clear the cart afterward.
2. Developed a “My Orders” page where buyers can view all their orders along with relevant details, ensuring transparency and easy access to purchase history.

Excited to continue — seller-side order management coming next! 🔥
