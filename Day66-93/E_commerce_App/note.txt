🌟 Day 93 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange 🌟
Today, I focused on improving user–seller communication and building trust 
by ensuring accurate email display and adding confirmation emails after 
authentication events. ✉️✅💡

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Replaced user email with the seller’s official email in UI and API responses to prevent confusion.
2. Implemented automated confirmation emails after successful signup and login for better user experience.
3. Improved UI clarity around email display by refining layout and labels.

📦 Next Steps: Add branded email templates and track email delivery for better analytics. 🚀

Excited for what’s next! 🔥
