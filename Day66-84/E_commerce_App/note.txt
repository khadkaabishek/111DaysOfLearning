🌟 Day 84 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange 🌟
Today, I built the backend for user interactions — enabling users to like and comment 
on products, all while ensuring secure authentication and clean backend structure. 💬🔐❤️

🎯 What I worked on:
1. Created an Interaction model with attributes like `isLiked`, `comment`, `user`, and `product`.
2. Wrote controllers for posting and retrieving interactions from the database.
3. Developed a separate middleware to verify JWT tokens — keeping endpoints secure and clean.
4. Used Postman to test all API endpoints and verify smooth data flow and response handling.
