Today, I worked on enhancing the admin-side item editing feature — 
now admins can easily update existing product details in case of 
errors or any necessary changes. This adds flexibility and ensures
 data accuracy across the platform! 🛠️

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Fetched existing product data and pre-filled it into an editable form using `GET`.
2. Allowed admin to update product fields like name, description, price, quantity, and category.
3. Enabled multiple image uploads with preview support using `FormData` and `multer`.
4. Sent updated data via a secure `PUT` request to `/api/put_item/:id`.
5. Updated backend logic to handle both text and image data using `multipart/form-data`.

The admin panel is now more robust and production-ready,
allowing seamless edits to product listings with image management! 🚀✨
