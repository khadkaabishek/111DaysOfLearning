🌟 Day 89 of #111DaysOfLearningForChange 🌟
Today, I focused on building the Admin Panel frontend — creating a secure and 
structured interface accessible only to users with the `admin` role. This forms 
the foundation for managing users, seller applications, and approvals. 🛡️🧑‍💻🗂️

🎯 What I worked on:

1. Added role-based routing logic to redirect admins to the dashboard after successful login.
2. Created a loading component to verify user roles before rendering any admin content — preventing unauthorized access or glitches.
3. Built structured admin views:

   * Users Page to view all registered customers.
   * Sellers Page to monitor onboarded sellers.
   * Requests Page to review and act on pending seller applications.(dummy data for now)

Super excited to see the admin dashboard taking shape — next step: implement approval actions and real-time status updates! 🚀
